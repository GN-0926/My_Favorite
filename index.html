        <p>Welcome to my fanpage! This site is dedicated to the Grishaverse and its series: The Shadow and Bone Trilogy, The Six of Crows Duology, and The King of Scars Duology! </p>
        <p>Here you will also find information about the tv show "Shadow and Bone" which is inspired by Leigh Bardugo's Shadow and Bone Trilogy and Six of Crows Duology.</p>

        <p>Bardugo is able to create a complex world filled with whip smart thieves and criminals, powerful armies, and detailed schemes that grab your attention at every turn of page!</p>
        <p>The story is centered around a universe populated by six countries: Ravka, Kerch, Fjerda, Shu Han, Novyi Zem, and the Wandering Isle! Each country has its own culture, traditions, and language. (Many of which often relate to large and well known societies in our history! s</p>
        <p>Watch as Bardugo starts her story in Ravka, a land based on historical Imperial Russia ruled by Czars.</p>
